# FAQ
**Q. How can I join the VBench‑I2V Leaderboard?**<br>

A: Choose one of three paths:

| Option  | Sampling Party  | Evaluation Party | Comments                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1️⃣** | **VBench Team** | **VBench Team**  | VBench Team handles everything — ideal for both open-source and closed-source models (if API access is provided). We periodically allocate resources to sample newly released models and perform evaluations. You can request us to perform sampling and evaluation, but the progress depends on our available resources.                       |
| **2️⃣** | **Your Team**   | VBench Team      | Submit your video samples via this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uiyIxjo_ncwdANRklFr3DCy73fbOl2J5fyuZirK0h60/edit). If you prefer to evaluate on your own, refer to Option 3.              |
| **3️⃣** | Your Team       | Your Team        | Already performed the full VBench-I2V evaluation? Submit your eval_results.zip files to the [VBench-I2V Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Vchitect/VBench_Leaderboard)'s `[I2V]Submit here!` form. The evaluation results will be automatically updated to the leaderboard. Make sure to also fill in model details in the `[I2V]Submit here!` form. Submissions lacking essential information may be removed periodically. |

**Q: For option 2️⃣ and 3️⃣ - What if my model has been updated and now performs better? Can I make a new submission to the VBench-I2V Leaderboard?**<br>
A: Yes, you can submit an updated version of your model. Please clearly specify what changes have been made and how this version differs from your previous submission. Updates will only be evaluated if the modifications are explicitly described.

**Q: For option 2️⃣ - After sharing a cloud storage link to our sampled videos, how long will it take to receive the evaluation results?**<br>
A: Once we receive both your cloud storage link and the corresponding model information, evaluation typically takes 1–2 weeks, depending on the current queue.

**Q: For option 1️⃣ and 2️⃣ - Is the evaluation fully automated?**<br>
A: Yes. The evaluation strictly follows the open-source procedure available in our official code repository. It is fully reproducible, with no manual intervention or subjective judgment involved.

**Q: For option 2️⃣ - If the evaluation results are unsatisfactory, can we resubmit new videos for the same model?**<br>
A: Evaluation results are final and tied to the specific model version submitted. However, you may submit a newer checkpoint or updated version of the model for a fresh evaluation. In such cases, please include a brief explanation of the updates. Previous results will remain on the leaderboard and will not be removed.

**Q: For option 2️⃣ - how should I organize the sampled videos for submission?**<br>
A: You can place all sampled videos in a single folder. The filenames should follow the format shown in [this example list](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench/blob/master/sampled_videos/i2v_sampled_videos.txt).
